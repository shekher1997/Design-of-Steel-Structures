# Design-of-Steel-Structures
Program for designing truss members based on Indian Standard Codes.

Pd Calculation - This program is to get suitable section for a particular length and particular axial load.
Program will give all the semicompact angle section (from 50x50x6 to 90x90x8) whose pd value is suitable for user's conditions.

Tension - this program is solely for checking semicompact angle section with fillet weld type connection against tension.

Weld design - program to design fillet weld for a particular load on a particular angle section.

Note : You can add more secton in section detail matrix if you want, but don't add slender section.
